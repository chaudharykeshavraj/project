tightly typed language and loosely typed language

JS = loosely typed, every where variable type mention not necessary
C / C++ = strictly typed language 


in JS first data is given and according data type is set
in C/C++ first data type is mentioned and then data is assigned

later on TypeScript is used besides JS

ES6 (ECMA Script): It is set of rules and JS is implementation.
